# motherboard-hack_this
A repository for various scripts I'll be working on based on the Hack This tutorial series by Michael Byrne

The idea is to use this series to quickly familiarise myself with Git and Github whilst also doing some cool things with Python.

<i>A note on the extractor.py script</i>:
If you feel like testing out the script, add your own picture (titled 'image.jpg') to the cloned directory and then run it accordingly. (Obviously adding my own picture would defeat the purpose!)
