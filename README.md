# motherboard-hack_this
A repository for various scripts I'll be working on based on the Hack This tutorial series by Michael Byrne

The idea is to use this series to quickly familiarise myself with Git and Github whilst also doing some cool things with Python.

<h2>What the scripts do</h2>
<h3>extractor.py</h3>
This is a script that extracts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif">Exif</a> data from a jpg image file. This includes things like the make and model of the device that took the picture, the date when it was taken, as well as more private information like the location where it was taken, etc.

If you feel like testing out the script, add your own picture (titled 'image.jpg') to a clone of the directory and then run it accordingly.
